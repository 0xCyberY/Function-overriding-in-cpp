# Function-overriding-in-cpp
ï¿½Function overriding is a feature that allows us to have a same function in child class which is already present in the parent class. A child class inherits the data members and member functions of parent class, but when you want to override a functionality in the child class then you can use function overriding. It is like creating a new version of an old function, in the child class.
